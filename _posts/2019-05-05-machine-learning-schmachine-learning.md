A few years ago "Big Data" exploded on to the scene and disrupted a whole lot of things. While I was not really a big fan of the term itself, I did understand the value of large volumes of data suddenly being available for analysis. The term reminded me of a disruption that happened in early 2000's in biosciences - "Systems Biology". The definition of Systems Biology, as put forward by one of its pioneers and a good friend, Hiraoki Kitano states - "Systems biology is a new field of biology that aims to develop a system-level understanding of biological systems." Wait, what? If you come from a Chemical engineering or control engineering background, you would understand why the definition was ridiculous. In fact, the term by itself was self-explanatory. A well known Russian investigator made fun of the whole thing at the Keynote address of the International Conference on Systems Biology in 2004. It was a hilarious talk. Hiraoki, in the front row was laughing his ass off as well. John Doyle from Caltech, another pioneer was his grumpy self the whole time. A couple of years later, when the excitement of Systems Biology had barely died down, Jay D. Keasling from Berkeley came up with Synthetic Biology. He marketed it so well that he was everywhere for while. He even appeared at The Colbert Report, you know, the program when Stephen Colbert was funny. He gave a keynote speech at an ICSB conference in Noordwijkerhout and promptly got trolled by a few professors who wondered if his whole synthetic biology schtick was just a ploy to attract funding.

Maureen Dowd of The New York Times once mentioned an interesting story about the famous conservative columnist and etymologist, William Safire, where she argued with him about the term "War on Terror" and questioning how you could wage a war against an ideology, to which he said that the term was fine because of its context. Likewise, I thought the term Big Data was a bit odd.
