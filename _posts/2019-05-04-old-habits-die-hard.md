Once I shifted back to India, I thought of following my passion for collecting old hardware again. When Flipkart pulled ebay off the market, my passion went down the drain as well. Given the regulatory landmines one needs to safely navigate before successfully ordering something of interest from a global store, I decided to focus only on the local market. These days, I contact the sellers directly and buy interesting old school shit they come into possession of. My wife really hates it, but a guy needs his toys, right? As long as I don't bring them to the main house, she's OK with it. I have a separate storage room in my property, so we have been able to work it out. The choices are fairly limited in India though. Still, tracking down some legacy shit of interest is immensely satisfying and the rush is simply fucking unbelievable.

I get asked many times as to why I collect old stuff. I cannot really explain why. May be it is the excitement of repairing and making them run again. When possessing the newest piece of computer, smartphone makes you cool, collecting old stuff might look stupid. But look at this the other way. It is only with technology that people think the new has more value than the old. Things are completely different when you look at art, for example. A masterpiece from 1000s of years ago is way more valuable than the latest painting. I look at old hardware like I do art. In fact, there are certain aspects of my day to day life that are still governed by legacy devices. Blackberry Curve 9300 is my primary phone and I still use a Blackberry Passport as my daily driver.
