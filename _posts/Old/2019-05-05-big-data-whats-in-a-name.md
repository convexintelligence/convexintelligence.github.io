Whenever I hear "Big Data", my mind automatically conjures up the above image. Data was fascinating and he is my sixth favorite character from the Star Trek universe after Spock, Kirk, Scotty, McCoy and Picard.  A few years ago, "Big Data" exploded on to the scene and disrupted a whole lot of things. I thought of the term as a stupid buzzword created by IT guys who suddenly had a close encounter of the third kind with an advanced alien entity called high school statistics. The phenomenon reminded me of a disruptive thing that happened in early 2000's in biosciences - "Systems Biology". The definition of Systems Biology, as put forward by one of its pioneers and a good friend, <b><a href="https://su.org/about/faculty/hioraki-kitano/" target="_blank">Hiroaki Kitano</a></b> states - "Systems biology is a new field of biology that aims to develop a system-level understanding of biological systems." Wait, what? If you come from a Chemical engineering or control engineering background, you would understand why the definition was ridiculous. In fact, the term by itself was self-explanatory. <b><a href="http://lernaconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Yuri Lazebnik</a></b>, a world renowned cancer biologist made fun of the whole thing at the Keynote address of the International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB) in 2004. It was fucking hilarious. Hiroaki, in the front row was laughing his ass off. <b><a href="http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~doyle/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">John Doyle</a></b> from Caltech, another pioneer of Systems Biology was his grumpy self the whole time. A couple of years later, when the excitement of Systems Biology had barely died down, <b><a href="https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/faculty/cbe/keasling" target="_blank">Jay D. Keasling</a></b> from Berkeley came up with an offshoot - "Synthetic Biology". He marketed it so well that he was everywhere for while. He even appeared at The Colbert Report, you know, the program when Stephen Colbert was funny. He gave a keynote speech at an  <b><a href="http://www.issb.org/" target="_blank">ICSB</a></b> conference in Noordwijkerhout, Holland and promptly got trolled by a few professors who wondered if his whole synthetic biology schtick was just a ploy to attract funding. That talk sounded like a crash course on how every cutting edge area in biological engineering can be lumped together so that you give it a fancy fucking name. I was more focused on the number of slides he was rapidly editing live during the presentation - Mad skills that!

Back to "Big Data". Data is fine, but big is where I thought the weird was. Words like, large, scale, volume made more sense than big. <b><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/2717" target="_blank">Roger Magoulas</a></b> probably wanted to maximize it's reach and calling something big is much simpler and easier to explain. I looked at "big data" as "high volume", "high velocity" data. Velocity - it was the key. That was what made the data "Big". Nowadays though, I don't bother a lot about the term. I realize now that the reason for my problem with the term was due to meeting a lot of people who thought it was fashionable to use the phrase and neither understanding really what it meant nor it's context. This reminds me of another interesting thing that I read long time back. <b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/maureen-dowd" target="_blank">Maureen Dowd</a></b> of The New York Times once mentioned an interesting story about the famous conservative columnist and libertarian thinker, <b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/william-safire" target="_blank">William Safire</a></b>, in which she argued with him about the term "War on Terror" questioning how one could wage a war against an ideology. Safire was an etymologist, a lexicographer and a distinguished language guru. But for someone who felt so strong about language and it's proper use, he told Dowd that "war on terror", the phrase was not wrong and the actual message was it's context. Speaking of Safire, I loved his writing, though some of his articles went way over my head when I was much younger. Here's a little snippet of him talking about political language.

There are still a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings about big data that need to be addressed. A lot of analytics implementation cases fail primarily due to a true lack of understanding of high velocity datasets. A few firms I consulted with, wanted a  "big data" infrastructure setup because their competitor had one. But, they weren't really generating "big data", so why bother? It took a lot of persuasion to make them think otherwise. Even today, I see people misinterpreting "big data" and claiming to find anything and everything, which is quite alarming. This is why I have planned to write a series of posts about "big data", Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In fact, I first wrote about "big data" almost 7 years ago talking about how "big" data should be to qualify being called "big data". I will repost that article next. Some of my experiences might help a few people to navigate the fals positives infested waters of "big data"
