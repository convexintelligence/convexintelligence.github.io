Welcome to my thoughts assimilator. I have been blogging for nearly a decade now. A couple of my sites are still online and one of them gets a lot of visitors even now. I wrote a lot about programming and technology back then. Here, I would like to write about things that I have seen and experienced at work that have shaped my life so far. As a starting point, I would like to repost some of the things that I wrote on my other sites. Although they are related to a few projects from early stages of my career, the lessons I learned have been tremendous and it is my humble belief that at least a few people might learn from me talking about my earlier experiences as well. The tone on this section might be a little direct - meaning, colorful language will be used quite frequently. Trust me, it's unintentional and I believe it is easier to write about thought processes without a filter. If you're sensitve to this, please check out the other sections of my website. Blog section is the only place where you will see me using such language. Read on....
