We experienced some unexpected close calls at work that required my complete attention over the last few days. It was a mess man! An unaccounted error in one of our models fucked us up! Long story short, a Russian colleague and I found some discrepancies in our model performance that rendered our strategy sub optimal. We carried out a careful review of our models and caught the motherfucking error - a simple statistical estimate that had grown over the years to have a life of its own! We performed a course correction and luckily, our losses were not that much.

Coming back to the error, in situations like this, the first thing that comes to mind is, whodunit? But, what's the fucking use. My colleague and I found the source, but we realized it was our collective failure as a team for not having caught the error much earlier. It doesn't make any sense to put the blame on someone else and act as if it wasn't our mistake. Technically, it wasn't but the model was our responsibility. Though the management insisted on the source, we took the blame collectively. Boss man was pissed off, but hey, our losses were minimal, so he sort of calmed down. When you want to share the accolades, you should also share the failures. Else, there is no point in working as a unit. I have met my Russian colleague in person, only once, a couple of months back, when I visited my firm in Europe. Otherwise, we interact only over video conferencing. I was a little worried that he might not be game to take one for the team. But, before I could even ask, he insisted we take the bullet. I am so glad and lucky to work with such wonderful people. He and I lead a team of 14 and this incident has only made our team stronger and more tight knit than ever before.

I really did not have to mention this here. But, think about it, why should you always highlight only your successes? It is absolutely unthinkable that we would get by our entire lives without encountering failures -  be it personal or professional. My failure could be a warning/lesson for someone who might change seeing my misfortune. Failures provide people with some of the biggest lessons in life. I have more than 15 years of professional experience and I have encountered failures a lot of times. At the same time, I have conquered each and every one of them and those failures have only made my life better. So, if you encounter failure, please don't fret. Understand why you failed and do what is necessary to correct yourself. Especially, when you are a Team Leader or a Manager, please for heaven sake do not try to deflect the blame! You will only come off as a giant asshole. There is absolutely nothing wrong in keeping the interest of the collective above your personal interest. Besides, focus on correcting the problem more than assigning blame. Don't worry about the higher-ups. Trust me, they would come around soon. This is not a popularity contest and act like a responsible leader. It's very easy to lead a team when you are succeeding. Leading a team during failures (for no fault of theirs or yours) is where your character shines.

If you deal with financial instruments, I am sure you would understand why avoiding failures is a big fucking deal. You could work for a manufacturing firm and your boneheaded strategy could run it to the ground and people wouldn't make you the issue. But, fail with a 1000 bucks of hard cold cash, you are the fucking Devil himself! It's sad, but it's true. Your investment strategy would have made billions for some HNI's but if you lose a million dollars (knowing very well that it's part of the whole package), people will always remember you as the guy who lost a million dollars, not as the guy who made 10 billion fucking dollars.

It is precisely for the aforementioned reason, there is very little room for error when working with financial products. You are like Damocles the whole time and there is absolutely no safety net! That's why I have always relied on my engineering and physics background to build models with a better prediction potential and safe bets. The error just showed that we were a bit complacent. Honestly, I could have just let it slide by and could have claimed that it was not a bug, but a feature. But, it would be intellectual dishonesty on my part if I had done that. As I had mentioned earlier, our losses were minimal. But if we had run the model long term, it would have been a disastrous investment strategy that would have actually killed the USP of our firm! Our urgency to correct it was solely motivated by our long term goals. 

If you encounter something similar, please work on it as early as possible. There are instances, where I have seen people ignoring simple things only to descend into absolute chaos when it fucks them up. So if you spot something funky, investigate, investigate, investigate! Our models' predictions after rectifying the error were 2% better than before. But it saved a lot of money and made our strategy unique -  the reason why people come to us in the first place! Mathematical elements don't care about your hard work or attitude. If you let your guard down, even for a little while, it would fuck you up for good! That's why math is fucking awesome!
