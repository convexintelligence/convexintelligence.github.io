      <h2>THE DEVIL IS IN THE QUANTITATIVE DETAILS</h2>
      <p align="justify">Oftentimes businesses are looking for that little nugget that would make them invincible in today's cut-throat environment. Large-scale data has become that goldmine to look for the elusive nugget. But without sustained direction, subject matter expertise and quantitative finesse, it would be an expensive exercise in failure to find anything of interest that would improve profitability. More data does not necessarily mean better predictions. Consequently, many contemporary businesses struggle in transforming their enthusiastic early adoption of analytics platforms into scalable solutions.</p>
      <p align="justify">Prem can help you implement comprehensive analytics solutions that overcome this transformation problem. With extensive academic experience in data mining, curation, method analysis, he has developed a range of problem specific data solutions, whose predictive capabilities are built on top of solid mathematical foundations. Prem understands the pitfalls that come with large datasets and attaches a lot of value to avoid making sweeping judgments about their capabilities.</p>
