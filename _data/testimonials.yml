  testimonial: "Prem has a thing for data. In an era where people claim to find the holy grail in almost every other dataset, Prem is a welcome change. Be it analysis or interpretation, he exercises great care and never loses his critical focus. In our business, life and death ride on data and he understands it very well. His analytical models are accurate, predictions right on the money - every single time. Fun fact - I first met Prem at our local Irish Pub and e quickly became my pool partner. Four years later, when he was finished with his research program I recruited him right away. "
